Backend services for our student/mentor sites

Create a virtualenv for the project, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Running `python setup.py` from the root will run a dev server.

You also must be running mongo and redis (run `mongod` and `redis-server` if the processes aren't running on their own)
